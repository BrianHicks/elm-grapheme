# Graphemes

Do string operations based on graphemes instead of codepoints or bytes.
Compare:

```elm
import String.Graphemes

String.toList "ü¶∏üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è" --> [ 'ü¶∏', 'üèΩ', '\u{200D}', '‚ôÇ', '\u{FE0F}' ]

String.Graphemes.toList "ü¶∏üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è" --> [ "ü¶∏üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è" ]
```

## What's going on here? Graphemes? What're those?

Unicode defines a system for encoding text as symbols called codepoints.
For example, `a` is codepoint 97, usually written in hex as 0061.
There are a wide range of possible codepoints (from 0000 to 10FFFF), although not all of those numbers are assigned a symbol.

A codepoint takes between one to four bytes in memory, both to maintain compatibility with older documents and to save space.
For example, `a` can be encoded in one byte but ü¶∏ takes four.
If they didn't vary in length, you would have to pad out `a` with 3 bytes worth of zeros just to support both in the same string!

Some codepoints stand on their own (like `a`), but others need to be used in combinations.
We call these combinations "graphemes", and they map to what you'd intuitively think of as a single character in a writing system.
So, for example, you can put `a` and `¬®` together to get `√§`.
You can do this for all kinds of diacritics: `¬¥`, `Àú`, `ÀÜ`, et cetera.

If you get really wild here, you end up with zÃ¥ÕíÃôaÃ¥ÃâÃÄÃÖÃ´ÃºÃ´lÃ¥ÃÅÃîÃøÕúgÃ∑ÃäÕêÃöÃ®ÕáÕâoÃ∂ÕåÃìÃ≥Ã£ÃØ!

But this system isn't just for diacritics.
Tons of writing systems use graphemes: Hangul, Devanagari, Thai, and Tamil among others!
An easy one to talk about for English speakers is emoji: ü¶∏üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è is composed of ü¶∏ + üèΩ + zero-width joiner (200D) + ‚ôÇ + variation selector 16 (FE0F).
You tend to think of ü¶∏üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è as a single character‚Äîa very definite expression which can't really be broken up into constituent parts.
That means it's a grapheme!
But if you used ü¶∏ by itself it's a grapheme too.
The point is not "what codepoints are there?", it's "what is the smallest useful unit when writing?"

### So what?

The above means that when we ask questions like "how long is this string?" or "what is the first character here?" we sometimes mix three levels:

1. **the byte level.**
   Operations like `String.length` and `String.left` operate here.
   You should operate here if you're working with [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) or [ISO 8859-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1) data, but working at the byte level with unicode text is a good way to break your document.

2. **the codepoint level.**
   Here, our base superhero emoji is only one character, but our skin tone and gender (ü¶∏üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) take more like we discussed.
   This combination happens to be 17 *bytes* but only 5 *codepoints*.
   Operations like `String.foldl` operate here (so you can measure length with operations like `String.foldl (\_ len -> len + 1) 0`.)
   You should operate here if you're implementing higher-level operations on the codepoints, like grapheme segmentation (hi!) or normalization.

3. **the grapheme level.**
   Despite being 5 codepoints, ü¶∏üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇ is only one graphemeÔ∏è.
   Operations like `String.Graphemes.toList` operate here.
   You should operate here if you're modifying unicode text in ways meaningful to a user.

To underscore, if you're modifying text that the user has entered, work at the grapheme level.
This reduces the possibility of errors and increases the possibility that your program will "do the right thing."

Still not convinced?
Here are some practical reasons you should work at the grapheme level in the browser:

- If you operate at the *byte* level, you will split multi-byte characters into invalid unicode sequences.
  If you do the wrong thing with these sequences, you'll crash your user's browser.
  In fact, that's what started me writing this library!
  Everyone does it occasionally, but there are better ways.

- If you operate at the *character* level, you will split skin tones and genders off of people emoji, split flags into country codes, and move diacritic marks around.
  Your user entered this text precisely in these cases, don't lose their meaning!

- Think you don't need those pesky diacritic marks?
  Think again!
  They're crucial to understanding in a lot of languages!
  For example, in Spanish, papa (potato) is different than pap√° (father.)
  Don't make your users call their dad a potato!
